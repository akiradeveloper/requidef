# Version 0.1.0
The consequence of 10H rapid developement.   
It had many bugs so we could not use the command after 'gem install'ing. 

# Version 0.2.0

We found that the .rd file is not as easy to edit as we had expected.  
So we decided to edit file in XMind, a free MindMap tool, export it to HTML to translate to .rd file.  
Other features,  
* The commandline I/F is changed
* Fixed the flashed bugs in 0.1.0
* Provides some converter functionality
* It is now ready to get started by just gem installing

# Version 0.3.0
(Below describes the future which is not happened still.)  

* Add more format to translate (TGF, GML, ..).
