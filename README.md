# requidef
Requiem for the boring Requirement Definitions.
Save time and get back to coding.

## Motivation
Do you know the most and the last thing that hinder our technology grow rapidly in this century?
The most harmful software, you know that is the MS Office.
We, workers, are forced to write ten of thousand of lenghty documents with MS Word, MS Excel ... you know what.
I disrespect every single of the softwares MS provides.
Today, we declared to be free from these greedy evils.

This software, requidef [r`ekwidef], will guide you to the haven where any documentation works are happy.

## Installation
Only for Ruby >= 1.9
just 'gem install requidef'.

## Contributing to requidef
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
